# Meeramuni

## Background
This project involves the ongoing development of a language course for Meeramuni (exonymic name: Miyara), a Yaeyaman (Southern Ryukyuan; Japonic) language spoken in Ishigaki, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. 
The Ryukyuan languages were historically oppressed since the annexation of the Ryukyu Kingdom in 1879. 
As a result, the languages have become severely endangered: there are no monolingual speakers and most speakers are over the age of 70. 
These languages have also been devalued as “dialects” of Japanese (despite the lack of intelligibility on the part of Japanese speakers with no exposure to them), furthering their endangered status. 
The current project involves materials gathered by the mentor between 2012 and 2017.
